          <p> Andorra consists of Kevin McCall, Jordan Petrellis, Michael Trycieckyj, and Dante DiLoreto. The band officially formed in 2010, hailing from Philadelphia, PA and named themselves after the respective city suburb (not the country.) You can catch them LIVE, in dive, sporting beards and clad in flannel. 
              The group of 20 something-year-olds released their acclaimed "heavy in all the right places," Sophomore album "What You Wanted, What You Got," in 2017. The record reflects on their time as college students trying to adjust to new living arrangements. It's a “coming of age” story about missing the place you used to call home. 
              Recently, the "official Radio 104.5 house band," teamed up with Broad Street Beard Co., a local beard oil company to collaborate on an Andorra-themed fragrance called the "Boozehound Signature," named after the band's song.
